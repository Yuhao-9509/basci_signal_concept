# Basci signal concepts
I am currently exploring fundamental concepts related to signals. To enhance my comprehension of this subject, I am employing Python to develop code for implementing these fundamental concepts and facilitating communication with others.

The initial concept I am focusing on is the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

The second concept is related to gradients or derivatives.
